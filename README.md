Design Patterns:




1. Structural Design Patterns: Combine different classes and objects to form a complex structure to solve particular requirement.
Composition, inheritance and all.
ðŸ‘‰ Decorator Pattern:     
ðŸ‘‰ Proxy Pattern:     
ðŸ‘‰ Composite Pattern:     
ðŸ‘‰ Adapter Pattern:     
ðŸ‘‰ Bridge Pattern:      
ðŸ‘‰ Facade Pattern:     
ðŸ‘‰ Flyweight Pattern:      
Types:
	1. Decorator Pattern: Adds more functionality to existing object without changing its structure.
	Eg : Adding more layers like cheese, mushroom,vegies on base pizza.
	Class Explosing: When we are adding class by class for each topping.

	2. Proxy Pattern: Helps provide control access to original object.
	Eg: Client-->ApplicationProxy--->Application(if roles are matching for login)

	3. Composite Pattern: Helps in scenarios where we have Object inside Object like structure nested objects.
	Eg: FileSystem, Delivery Box(Tree Like strcture)  File (Leaf) and Directory(Composite)

	4.Adapter Pattern: Act as a bridge/intermediate between 2 incompatible objects.
	Client-->Adapter-->Adaptee. Eg: WeightMachine that is returning in pounds and we have used a adpater to get weight in kg as client wants in kg only.

	5. Bridge Pattern: Decouple an abstraction with its implementation, so two can vary independently. 
	Eg: Living things breatheProcess() method for different Dog,Fish and Tree  so decoupled both LivingThings and BreatheImplementor abstraction so both can scale independently.

	6.Facade Pattern: Helps to hide system comlexity from client. 
	Eg1: Exposes only necesaary details to client. Client-->EmployeeFacade--->EmployeeDao(having many functions for insert,delete)
	Eg2: Hide system complexity from client. Client-->ACFacade-->AcExternalUnit & AcInternalUnit(having many functionality to turn on AC)

	7.Flyweight Pattern: Helps to reduce memory usage by sharing data among multiple objects.
	Intrinsic data:  Shared among objects and remain same once assigned one value. Body and Type is Intrinsic data.
	Extrinsic Data: Values changed on client input values. X and Y axis.
	Keep only Intrinsic data in object. This is called Flyweight object.
	Extrinsic Data can be passed in from client.So pass these in parameters.
	Eg: In a game we have a make 5L RobiticDog and 5L humanoidSprite and consuming total 31 Gb for space and space is 21 Gb only. 
	Robot-->Humanoid (keep only intrinsic data)
		--> RobotidDog (keep only intrinsic data)
	Need to use cache for getting same type object and display it in x-y coordinate.
